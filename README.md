- **Docker Support**: Complete containerization with Docker Compose

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (.NET 8)

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8 Web API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer Tokens
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for async notifications
- **Real-time Communication**: SignalR for WebSocket connections
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design

### Frontend (Vue.js 3)

- **Framework**: Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State Management**: Pinia
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Routing**: Vue Router
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with interceptors

### Infrastructure

- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 18
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ 3.12
- **Web Server**: Nginx (frontend)

## üîÑ Real-time Notification System

### SignalR Integration

The application uses ASP.NET Core SignalR to provide real-time functionality:

### Notification Flow

- Task Assignment: When a task is assigned to a user
- RabbitMQ: Backend publishes message to RabbitMQ
- Message Consumer: Processes the message and saves to database
- SignalR: Sends real-time notification to specific user via WebSocket
- Frontend: Receives notification and shows toast instantly

### Features

- **Live Toast Notifications**: Instant popup notifications for new tasks
- **Notification Center**: Dedicated page to view all notifications
- **Real-time Updates**: Notifications appear without page refresh
- **User-specific**: Notifications are sent only to relevant users

Mark as Read: Users can mark notifications as read

### Notification Types

- **Task Assigned**: When a task is assigned to you
- **Task Updated**: When an assigned task is modified
- **Task Completed**: When a task is marked as completed
